    <h1>Understanding Key Stock Metrics</h1>
    <p>When comparing companies, certain financial metrics can help you understand their value and performance. Below, we've broken down some of the key metrics to help you make sense of them.</p>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>Market Capitalization (Market Cap)</h2>
        <p>Market Cap is the total value of a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the stock price by the number of outstanding shares. A higher market cap indicates a larger, more established company.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>Enterprise Value (EV)</h2>
        <p>Enterprise Value represents the total value of a company, including its debt. It is often seen as a more accurate measure of a company's worth than market cap because it considers both equity and debt. EV is the sum of the market cap and the company's debt, minus any cash.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>Trailing P/E Ratio</h2>
        <p>The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio compares a company's current stock price to its earnings per share (EPS) over the past 12 months (trailing). A higher P/E suggests that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings, often due to expectations of future growth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>Forward P/E Ratio</h2>
        <p>The Forward P/E ratio is similar to the trailing P/E, but instead of looking at past earnings, it uses projected future earnings. This metric gives investors an idea of how expensive the stock might be relative to its expected earnings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>PEG Ratio</h2>
        <p>The Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio factors in a company's expected earnings growth, giving a more comprehensive view than the P/E ratio alone. A lower PEG ratio can indicate a stock is undervalued based on its growth prospects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio</h2>
        <p>The Price-to-Sales ratio compares a company's stock price to its revenues. A lower P/S ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued relative to its revenue. This is especially useful when a company has no earnings yet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio</h2>
        <p>The Price-to-Book ratio compares the company's stock price to its book value (the value of its assets minus liabilities). A lower P/B ratio might suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its assets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>Enterprise Value to Revenue (EV/Revenue)</h2>
        <p>This ratio compares the company's Enterprise Value to its revenue. It shows how much investors are valuing the companyâ€™s revenue. A lower EV/Revenue ratio can indicate that the company is undervalued relative to its revenue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric">
        <h2>Enterprise Value to EBITDA</h2>
        <p>EV/EBITDA compares the company's Enterprise Value to its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA). This ratio is often used to value companies with a lot of debt. A lower EV/EBITDA ratio suggests the company may be undervalued compared to its earnings potential.</p>
    </div>
